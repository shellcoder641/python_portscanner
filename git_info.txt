#Ways to use git:
#create a directory where you will be working and saving your project.
$ git init

#Check the status of the directory and all the files:
$ git status

#Add a file for git to track for changes:
$ git add filename

#Now if we modify the tracked file, we can track the changes:
$ git diff filename
#The + sign is what we have added

#Store changed permanently into repository:
$ git commit -m "Message... "

#Log back all the commits.
$ git log

#When this file is modified after being committed, we need to add it again and do another commit.
#The line in red means that the file is modified and need to be added and commit again for changes
#to store permanently.

#The currently commit is known as the HEAD commit:
$ git show HEAD
#Show all the changes.
