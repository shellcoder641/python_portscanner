#Ways to use git:
#create a directory where you will be working and saving your project.
$ git init

#Check the status of the directory and all the files:
$ git status

#Add a file for git to track for changes:
$ git add filename

#Now if we modify the tracked file, we can track the changes:
$ git diff filename
#The + sign is what we have added

#Store changed permanently into repository:
$ git commit -m "Message... "

#Log back all the commits.
$ git log
